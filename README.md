# SMS-Spam-Classifier-models
We will be creating SMS spam classifier models using two text preprocessing techniques Stemming and Lemmatization along with Bag of Words and TF-IDF models.

Definitions:
1. Stemming: It is a process of transforming a word to its root form.
2. Lemmatization: Unlike stemming, lemmatization reduces the words to a word existing in the language.
3. Bag of Words: It just creates a set of vectors containing the count of word occurrences in the document. It's vectors are easy to interpret.
4. TF-IDF: Term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It usually performs better in machine learning models.

Note:
1. Stemmer is easy to build than a lemmatizer as the latter requires deep linguistics knowledge in constructing dictionaries to look up the lemma of the word.
2. Lemmatization is preferred over Stemming because lemmatization does a morphological analysis of the words.
